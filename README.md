# Robotic_Dog
This repository displays my robotic dog project, including the STL, Gerber, and Ino files. It also offers a glimpse into my thoughts and ideas throughout the design process, including previous iterations of various design aspects.

## General Overview
Each leg of the dog is 30cm long and contains three MG996R servo motors: two for shoulder actuation and one for knee actuation.
